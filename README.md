# 12_Coin_Nim

### This is a fun little command line game I made based on the game "Dr. Nim" from the 60s!
The goal of the game is to be the first player to pick up the last coin. Players take turns removing 
up to 3 coins per turn from a pile of coins presented. The strategy is to determine how many coins you need to pick up
during each turn to ensure you are the one picking up the last coin. Originally this is played with 12 coins and sometimes 
more than 1 pile. I've decided to make it more interesting by allowing the player to choose the number of coins in the
starting pile in efforts to defeat my AI (very tough).

#### I hope you enjoy playing and I plan to add more mechanics and UI elements in the future to enhance the game play.
